# FlowNotes

FlowNotes is a web-based tool for fluid personal note-taking. It allows you to
forget about organisation, layout and even saving, to keep you in the flow of
writing your thoughts down.

## Features
* Web-based for easy access from any device
* Flat text notes for maximum compatibility
* Github-style Markdown markup if you need a bit of styling
* View mode to see the rendered layout with clickable links
* Stored in a single industry-standard SQLite database file
* Full-text search to find any note you're looking for
* Pinned notes to keep those important ones always within reach
